	* test.lisp: Added rules for testing segment matcher, and cases
	for testing the trace facility.

	* rule-engine.lisp: Added rule tracing.

	* rule-compiler.lisp: Added functions for two-pass compilation of
	meta.lisp. This ensures that the compilation rules are compiled,
	in the right order, by rules defined through compilation rules. We
	now have truly meta-circular compiled rules.

	* meta.lisp (segment-compiler): Added segment variable compilation
	rule.

2001-03-21  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@firstworld.net>

	* rule-engine.lisp (get-encoder): Renamed from deep-car. Now
	requires that the encoder be a symbol.

	* defs.lisp: Moved rule and ruleset structures here from
	rule-engine.lisp, and added printers.

2001-03-19  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@everest.com>

	* rule-compiler.lisp: Added explicit definition of external rule
	compiler ruleset.
	(%subrule-form): Missed comma substitution.

	* meta.lisp (with-compilation): Improper handling of solve
	results. Solve returns only one value.

2001-03-19  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@firstworld.net>

	* rule-engine.lisp (solve): Added arguments for better controlling
	solve fail behavior.

	* meta.lisp (with-compilation): Added macro to facilitate
	sub-expression compilation.

2001-03-06  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@firstworld.net>

	* Added documentation.
	
	* rule-engine.lisp (store-rule): Now stores documentation
	strings.

	* rule-compiler.lisp: :|rule-compiler| rulesent renamed as
	:|internal-rule-compiler|. Added :|external-rule-compiler| ruleset
	which takes precedence over :|internal-rule-compiler| while
	compiling.
	(compile-rule): Introduction of more careful body parsing to
	detect documentation strings.

	* meta.lisp: Modified to define rules in :|internal-rule-compiler|
	rather than use DEFRULE-COMPILE.

	* packages.lisp (:mcpat): Eliminated export of ?is, added
	defrule-compile.

	* Updated all package and system refrences from XTE to MCPAT.

	* Initial branch from XTE package.
