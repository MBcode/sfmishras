	Merged in changes from cl-wiki to xl-wiki, and changed all
	cl-wiki references to xl-wiki. Also updated the license and
	readme.
	
2008-12-12  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@sfmishras.com>

	Test suite added for cl-wiki.
	
	* test/wiki-test-script.lisp: Added.
	(translation-tests): Added.
	(wiki-test-script): Added.

	* cl-wiki-tests.asd: Added.

	Three changes to support wiki extension: improvements in
	specifying the wiki class while starting the wiki, export symbols
	related to the extension API, and name the rewrites so that they
	can be easily manipulated.
	
	* wiki.lisp (reinit): Now updates the wiki server class to that
	provided in wiki configuration. Adds argument class-override-p.
	(init): Adds argument class-override-p.
	(start): Considers whether a class was explicitly supplied when
	instantiating wiki.

	* packages.lisp (#:cl-wiki): Exported functions related to
	extension API.

	* codes.lisp (make-rep-url-encoder): Higher order generator that
	replaces rep-url-encoder-1.
	(pre-escape-rewrites, post-escape-rewrites): Rewrites are now
	named so that alternate wikis can provide their custom rules more
	easily. The link patterns now use make-rep-url-encoder.
	((rewrite (wiki t string))): Updated for changes to
	pre-escape-rewrites and post-escape-rewrites.

2008-10-25  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@sfmishras.com>

	Redid the wiki code translation in terms of generic functions such
	that wiki codes can provide context for the interpretation of
	other wiki codes. Also moved wiki.conf to the source directory and
	added support for specifying paths relative to the wiki.conf.
	
	* codes.lisp (pre-escape-rewrites): *unescaped-replace-list*
	content defined as a GF to support customization.
	(post-escape-rewrites): Replaces *replace-list* to support
	customization. Also eliminated dropping <br> tags.
	(*translate-context*): Added.
	(reconstitute): Added.
	(rewrite): Added in place of translate-wiki-codes.
	(segment): Added.
	(make-translate-context): Added.
	((translate (wiki t)): Rewritten in terms of *translate-context*,
	segment, rewrite, reconstitute.

	* defs.lisp (*wiki-software-directory*): Defined.

	* wiki.lisp (config-pathname): Added.
	(read-config): Factored out configuration file pathname computation.
	(string-to-directory-pathname): Ensure the return value is an
	absolute pathname by merging it into *wiki-software-directory*.
	(reinit): Change call to read-config.

2008-10-14  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@sfmishras.com>

	Convert some additional functions to generic functions. Move key
	definitions in wiki.lisp to defs.lisp. Minor change to fix a
	warning in encode-for-pre.lisp.
	
	* wiki.lisp (save, execute-main-template, edit, display):
	Converted to generic functions.

	* encode-for-pre.lisp (encode-for-tt): Account for implementations
	where #\Newline is the same as #\Linefeed. The change suppresses a
	warning signaled in Clozure CL.

	* codes.lisp (translate): Convert to generic function.

	* cl-wiki.asd (#:cl-wiki): Add file defs.lisp.

	* defs.lisp (*wiki-port*, *wiki-directory*)
	(*wiki-template-directory*, *wiki-page-list*, *wiki-home-page*)
	(*behind-proxy-p*, *page-index*, *edit-textarea-size*)
	(*wiki-server*, *emb-lock*, *page-index-lock*, wiki): New file to
	hold the variable and class definitions from wiki.lisp.

2008-10-13  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@sfmishras.com>

	* templates/main.template: Simplify title text, and remove top
	line of navigation links. These are all unnecessary.

2008-10-13  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@sfmishras.com>

	Basic extensions via CLOS by introducing a base wiki class.
	
	* wiki.lisp (*wiki-server*): Updated documentation to reflect new
	role.
	(wiki): Added.
	(wiki): Made primary call handler a generic function that takes
	server as argument.
	(reinit): Was previously named init, now takes a server
	argument. Server is passed to the default Hunchentoot dispatcher.
	(init): A new function that performs a very different task from
	the previous function. It creates the wiki instance and calls
	reinit.
	(start): Add a class argument, insert a check for existence of
	server, remove check at start time for wiki directory. Set the
	HTTP server into a field of the server instance.
	(stop): Retrieve server from field of server instance. Unset the
	server instance.
