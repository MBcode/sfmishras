	* ntriple.lisp (stringify): If the input is a string, just return
	it.

2009-03-26  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@sfmishras.com>

	* package.lisp ("SCOLI"): Exported repository-store.

2009-02-28  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@sfmishras.com>

	Implemented storing content into the repository. Refactored code
	to more cleanly express the process of storing content.
	
	* sesame.lisp (default-sesame-content-language): Renamed from
	default-sesame-response-language.
	(sesame-connection): Renamed slot response-language to
	content-language.
	(url-for-request-type): Modified to construct full URL, applying
	arguments to the request URL. Added an args argument for this
	purpose. This simplifies the use of this function elsewhere.
	(language-string): Renamed from query-language-string.
	(language-mime-type): Renamed from response-language-string,
	reflecting the generalization of the use of this function.
	(sesame-request): Changed function signature to give more
	flexibility in argument patterns. This was to support the POST
	method through this function.
	((parse-response (sesame-connection (eql :null) t ...))): Added.
	((repository-query (sesame-connection string ...)))
	((repository-retrieve (sesame-connection ...))):
	Renamed	argument response-language to content-language.
	(repository-store): Added.
	
2009-02-25  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@sfmishras.com>

	Implemented queries via the statement URI to the sesame triple
	store. Added the required minimal ntriples support for this task.
	
	* package.lisp ("SCOLI"): Exported symbols.
	("NTRIPLE"): Added package.

	* sesame.lisp (+sesame-operations+): Added statements URI.
	(repository-retrieve): Added.

2009-02-23  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@sfmishras.com>

	Incorporation of cl-rdfxml to parse rdf responses from sesame. In
	response to sparql queries, sesame produces rdf, so the default
	response type for sesame has been changed to rdf.

	* sesame.lisp (default-sesame-response-language): Change value to
	:rdfxml.
	((response-language-string (sesame-connection t))): Change :rdf to
	:rdfxml.
	((parse-response :around (sesame-connection t string ...))): Added
	placeholder for future error checking.
	((parse-response (sesame-connection (eql :rdfxml) t ...))): Added.

	* scoli.asd (scoli): Incorporate cl-rdfxml.

	yet implemented.
	
	* sesame.lisp (default-sesame-response-language): Added.
	(sesame-connection): Added slot response-language.
	((query-language-string (sesame-connection (eql :default))):
	Added.
	((response-language-string (sesame-connection (eql :default))):
	Added.
	((response-language-string (sesame-connection t)): Added
	translation for :rdf format.
	((repository-query (sesame-connection string &rest args ...): 
	Include infer-p and bindings in query. Make response-language
	handling symmetric to query-language handling.

2009-02-19  Sunil Mishra  <smishra@sfmishras.com>

	Implemented much improved request marshalling and sparql
	unmarshalling. Repository retrieval now based on this new
